Republic of Moldova has the highest density of gas stations per capita from Europe. These are often used not only for car fuel supply, 
but also for the driver and passengers to have a cup of coffee or other necessities they require at a long road. Some of them,
especially in rural areas are places of people gathering for a chat or to have some fun. 
Having a proper geo data of the gas stations distribution and road load statistics, it is possible to recommend one that intends to open a
new gas station in a particular area regarding its necessity. For an existing station, you can check whether it is justified its existence.
There are 2 csv files with data used for this project: one that comprises existing gas stations geo data and the other one is regarding
the road load statistics for several roads, with exact portion of road indication.

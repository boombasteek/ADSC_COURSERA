Republic of Moldova has the highest density of gas stations per capita from Europe. These are often used not only for car fuel supply, 
but also for the driver and passengers to have a cup of coffee or other necessities they require at a long road. Some of them,
especially in rural areas are places of people gathering for a chat or to have some fun. 
Having a proper geo data of the gas stations and customers feedback can help one that intends to open a new gas station in a particular 
area regarding its necessity. For an existing station, you can compare the feedbacks with another ones from the neighborhood.
The existing gas stations geo data can be taken from https://www.mylpg.eu/, while the customer feedback data can be retrieved from
the respective gas stations chain Facebook page (ex: Rompetrol Moldova - https://www.facebook.com/pg/Rompetrol.Moldova/community/?ref=page_internal).
